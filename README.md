# Pune-Rental-Insights--EDA
 Pune Real Estate Analysis – Powered by Magicbricks Data
What happens when curiosity meets data? This project is my answer.

As someone fascinated by how cities grow and how people choose homes, I decided to dive into the real estate scene of Pune—one of India's fastest-growing cities. And what better source than Magicbricks, a leading property listing platform?
-I scraped data from the website and built a dataset with everything from price, location, furnishing types, carpet area, availability, and even the ad titles themselves.
-But like every real-world dataset, it came with its own set of challenges. The data was noisy, inconsistent, and messy. For example:

Furnishing types weren't labeled uniformly.
1)Prices came with currency symbols (₹) and commas, making them unreadable as numbers.
2)Some entries were just... odd.
3)To clean all this, I used a combination of regex, pandas, and lots of patience. It was a great hands-on experience in data wrangling—definitely not as glamorous as it sounds, but super rewarding.

Once the data was clean, I went full-on into EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis). I explored:

What kind of properties dominate which areas?

Do fully-furnished homes exist more in premium zones?

Is there a link between carpet area and furnishing style?

Some of the insights were really exciting:

Central areas like Koregaon Park and Baner had more fully-furnished homes.

Unfurnished properties were mostly in emerging or affordable localities.

Price per square foot varied wildly—almost painting a map of Pune’s real estate tiers.

The most exciting part? Seeing patterns emerge from raw, chaotic data. That’s the magic of analysis. 🧠✨
